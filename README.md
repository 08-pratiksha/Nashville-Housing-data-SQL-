# Nashville-Housing-data-SQL-
This is an SQL Project on Housing data which undergoes the data cleaning procedure for enhancing the data quality
In this I used MYSQL Workbench for running the queries
I converted some dates to remove unnecessary timestamps; I populated data for null values; I changed address columns from containing all of the address and city into separate columns; I removed duplicate rows; and I deleted unused columns.
